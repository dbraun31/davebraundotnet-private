title: "Does the brain cope with anxiety by numbing out?"
summary: We found that the brain is less sensitive to signals from the heart (a key dynamic for emotional processing) during highly energized states---an effect that was more pronounced for those high in anxiety. In this post, I walk through a really cool whole-brain analysis I used to uncover this effect.

<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>I used EEG and unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze how
the brain processes internal signals (interoception) and its link to anxiety. I
found that the brain is less sensitive to internal signals during high energy
states, a pattern that was amplified during states of anxiety—insights from
this project are relevant to stress detection and human-centered design.</p>

<p>Sometimes life is angsty. We’ve all been there—you’re about to talk in front
of a group, have a difficult conversation with someone, or do some task where a
mistake would be really bad. While it might be healthier not to avoid anxiety,
sometimes it’s just easier to reach for a distraction. What you may not know is
that your brain might subconsciously be trying to avoid anxiety as well.</p>

<h3>We wanted to look at how the brain responds to heartbeats across different states of anxiety and energy</h3>
<p>Previous research suggests that anxiety disrupts our brain’s <em>subconsious</em>
sensitivity to bodily signals, a sensitivity referred to as <em>interoception</em>.
<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Interoception is our brain’s way of sensing and regulating many of the
body’s functions, such as breathing and responding to heart rhythms.</p>
<p>Differences in interoception have also been linked to differences in one’s sense
of energy or activation<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>—a sense we’ll refer to
as <em>subjective arousal</em>. Subjective arousal—much like anxiety and
interoception—is continually and spontaneously fluctuating, even when people
are just at rest. But no previous study has looked at how subjective arousal,
anxiety, and interoception spontaneously fluctuate with each other at rest.</p>
<p>We wanted to look at how the brain responds to bodily signals—specifically,
heartbeats—during spontaneous fluctuations in subjective arousal when people
are at rest, and how this interaction might be different for those low vs. high
in anxiety. How these processes play out at rest might be important because
certain brain networks are typically only active at rest, and these networks
contribute to patterns like rumination and worry that feed into anxiety.
<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Understanding how the brain shifts interoception in response to changing
subjective arousal states during rest might help us better understand processes
that underlie anxiety.</p>

<h3>We measured electrical activity from the brain and heart during rest and occassionally asked people how they were feeling</h3>
<p>A precise way to measure neural interoception is through what’s called the
<em>heartbeat evoked potential</em> (HEP), which is basically the brain’s
electrophysiological response to heartbeats.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Your brain is constantly emitting
electricity (emanating from the communication between neurons), and when the brain’s
electrical response is high following a heartbeat, that’s thought to reflect
higher levels of neural interoceptive sensitivity to the heart.</p>
<p>Participants (51) came into our lab and completed a survey indicating their
level of state anxiety, or how much anxiety they were experiencing <em>in that
moment</em>. We then fitted them with an EEG cap to measure their neural electrical
signals. This EEG cap included 31 scalp electrodes plus an electrode that we
placed on participants’ back (ECG) to measure their heartbeat activity (see
<em>Figure</em> <a href="#fig:eeg">2</a>).</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:eeg"></span>

</p>
</div>
<p>Participants stared at a blank screen and were told to let their minds wander
freely. Every so often, a set of questions (ie, a <em>thought probe</em>) appeared
asking participants to report different aspects of their experience. Most
important was the question asking about their level of <em>subjective arousal</em>,
which includes feelings of energy linked to emotion, and participants gave
ratings on a scale from 0 (completely deactivated) to 100 (completely activated;
see <em>Figure</em> <a href="#fig:design">3</a>A).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>To calculate the HEP, I isolated the 10 s period before the onset of a thought
probe and extracted the EEG signals (from all 31 electrodes) that occurred
directly after a heartbeat (see <em>Figure</em> <a href="#fig:design">3</a><em>B</em>). I then separated
the 10 s pre-probe periods according to whether the subjective arousal rating
obtained during the thought probe was high or low (based on a
within-participants median split on subjective arousal).</p>
<p>Finally, I averaged across the high vs. low levels of subjective arousal
(collapsing across heartbeats and probes), which gave me one averaged brain
signal value for timepoints immediately following a heartbeat, for each EEG
channel, for each subjective arousal condition, across all participants. In
other words, we had for each participant an array of shape (timepoints x channel
x condition), or (100 x 31 x 2).</p>
<p>Ultimately, we wanted to know how interoceptive sensitivity to cardiac signals (as measured
with HEPs) is different in periods leading up to self-reported high vs. low
states of subjective arousal. To assess this, I took those arrays defined
in the previous paragraph and conducted a whole brain analysis using what’s
called a <strong>cluster-based permutation test</strong>.</p>
<p>Cluster-based permutation test is a super powerful and flexible data-driven
method for finding differences between conditions in high-dimensional space. In
our example, the conditions are a median split on subjective arousal ratings,
each thought probe was labelled as “high” or “low” subjective arousal. The high
dimensional space is the remaining (time x channels) array of EEG data for each
participant. In short, we want to find whether EEG voltage is different across
high vs. low levels of subjective arousal conditions at any timepoint(s) and for
any EEG channel(s).</p>

<u>Technical spotlight</u>: Cluster-based permutation testing
</h2>
</div>
<div id="what-is-a-cluster-based-permutation-test" class="section level3">
<h3>What is a cluster-based permutation test?</h3>
<p>We’re trying to find a meaningful pattern in brain data, but brain data is <strong>massive</strong>. In our case, we’re looking across 6,200 data points. If we tested each one individually, we’d almost certainly get false positives (random noise that <em>looks</em> meaningful).</p>
<p>A <strong>cluster-based permutation test</strong> helps solve this.</p>
<p><strong>The core idea:</strong></p>
<p>Instead of asking “is this single time point significant?”, we ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there <strong>clusters</strong> of nearby data points that are all showing an effect?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a real difference exists, we expect it to show up not just as a blip, but as a <strong>spatially or temporally coherent cluster.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Compute the actual data difference</strong> between two groups (eg, high vs. low subjective arousal) at every point in time or space.</li>
<li><strong>Identify clusters</strong> of adjacent points that pass some basic threshold (eg, t-values &gt; 2).</li>
<li><strong>Calculate a cluster-level statistic</strong> (like the sum of t-values) for each cluster.</li>
<li><strong>Randomly shuffle</strong> the group labels many times (eg, 5,000 permutations) and repeat steps 1-3 each time.</li>
<li><strong>Compare your original clusters</strong> to the shuffled ones. If a real cluster is bigger than 95% of the ones you’d see by chance, it’s considered statistically significant.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s so powerful because we don’t need to make <strong>assumptions</strong> about what the data would look like if there were no effect (ie, a null distribution). This allows us to compare many data points over an <em>arbitrary</em> number of dimensions to look for significant effects, making cluster-based permutation testing the perfect tool for finding differences in our brain data.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-i-implemented-it" class="section level3">
<h3>How I implemented it</h3>
<p>To make the cluster-based permutation test flexible and reproducible, I wrote a collection of functions in both Python and R and coordinated them with R’s fancy <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/">reticulate</a> package. The Python functions actually ran the cluster test using <a href="https://mne.tools/stable/generated/mne.stats.spatio_temporal_cluster_test.html"><code>mne.stats.spatio_temporal_cluster_test</code></a>, and the R functions were mostly for summarizing the result. I’m highlighting here the main Python function doing most of the work, but you can see the full set of functions on GitHub (for <a href="https://gist.github.com/dbraun31/23299f56013abba510e23014bc1d19d8">Python</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/dbraun31/8396dad9a13fa4fac9746a3108d6c94e">R</a>).</p>

<p>Let’s zoom into the important stuff.</p>
<p>The actual cluster-based permutation test is being run with this code:</p>
<div class="show-default">

</div>
<pre class="python"><code># Run test
t_obs, clusters, p_values, _ = spatio_temporal_cluster_test(
    X,
    n_permutations=1000,
    threshold=t_crit,
    tail=tail,
    n_jobs=None,
    seed = 1510,
    buffer_size=None,
    adjacency=adjacency,
    stat_fun=_my_t
)</code></pre>
<p>This function (<code>spatio_temporal_cluster_test</code>) comes from the <a href="https://mne.tools">MNE library</a>, which is an excellent set of EEG/MEG analysis tools written for Python. Let’s step through the important input arguments.</p>
<p><strong>The input data</strong></p>
<p>The input data (<code>X</code>) needs to be formatted as a list of arrays, where each array in the list is data from one of the conditions—in our case, the two subjective arousal conditions (high vs. low). This formatting is done by the following lines of code:</p>
<div class="show-default">

</div>
<pre class="python"><code># Get numpy arrays of shape (subjects, time, chans) for each condition
low, high = _format_for_clustering(dic, low_anchor, bads)

# Format data as list of arrays
X = [low[:, time_window_idx:, :],
    high[:, time_window_idx:, :]]</code></pre>
<p>I’m first calling one of my other functions (not shown above) to format the relevant data into two arrays split by subjective arousal condition. These arrays represent the data across each timepoint and channel for each subject. Next, I’m concatenating these two arrays into a list—taking only a subset of the time window with <code>time_window_idx</code>—which serves as our final input data <code>X</code>. We’re analyzing only a subset of the time window because we want to conduct our statistics only on those measurements that occur at least 250 ms after each heartbeat, which is to ensure that heartbeat activity doesn’t contaminate the neural activity we’re interested in analyzing.</p>
<p><strong>The statistical hyperparameters</strong></p>
<p>We need to configure a number of statistical hyperparameters that will influence how the cluster test algorithm runs. We first need to decide on what is a significant threshold for forming a cluster in the first place (ie, the <code>threshold</code> input argument). Since we’re only comparing two conditions within participants, the statistical test we use to compute this threshold is a <em>paired-samples t test</em>.</p>
<p>For each of the many, many comparisons across data points, the algorithm computes one t test, and the threshold we set determines whether the resulting t value is considered significant. Significant t values that are adjacent to one another in data space are considered to be a “cluster”. For this type of test, it’s common to use an alpha value (ie, false positive rate) of 0.01 as a cluster forming threshold. But we need to convert that alpha to a t value, and for that we use the quantile function of the t distribution (ie, the function that maps probability values to t values, or the inverse cumulative distribution function):</p>
<div class="show-default">

</div>
<pre class="python"><code># Configure parameters
df = low.shape[0] - 1
t_crit = stats.t.ppf(1 - initial_alpha, df)
tail = 0 </code></pre>
<p>The degrees of freedom (df) is the number of participants minus 1, and we
subtract alpha from 1 to calculate the cumulative density between the tail of
the t distribution and the alpha value. Finally, <code>tail=0</code> tells the algorithm we
want to perform a two-tailed test, meaning either condition can have greater EEG
voltage than the other.</p>
<p>The algorithm returns the data points of all the clusters found, along with the t values across all data points, and cluster-specific p values. If a cluster has a p value of less than .05, we know there was a significant difference across subjective arousal conditions during the cluster’s time period and for that cluster’s channels.</p>

<p>We can see that, for just about all participants, ratings of subjective arousal
are largely unrelated to their average heart rate. We can also see that, for
many participants, thinking about the future was associated with higher
subjective arousal ratings. This makes sense if thinking about the future is
energizing or stressful.</p>

<h3>2. Interoceptive sensitivity to cardiac signals is stronger during states of lower subjective arousal</h3>
<p>To assess whether interoception to cardiac signals changes based on subjective arousal, we examined the results of the cluster-based permutation test, and found one significant cluster. This cluster occurred largely over frontal electrodes about 350 ms post heartbeat.</p>
