title: "How perceptions of community behavior improve COVID-19 predictions"
summary: "Can crowdsourced perceptions improve pandemic forecasting? In this project, I explore how reports of community compliance with public health measures shaped COVID-19 spreadâ€”and highlight a powerful Bayesian model we used to predict future case trends."

### TL;DR 

I built models that accurately predicted COVID-19 case numbers up to three weeks aheadâ€”using not just case data, but also how well people thought their communities were following safety guidelines like social distancing. This approach shows how public perception can be used to improve real-time forecasting tools for organizations like the CDC.


### Key Skills
* ðŸ“ˆ **Time-Series Forecasting** â€“ Applied epidemiological models to predict COVID-19
cases using behavioral and clinical data

* ðŸ§  **Bayesian Modeling** â€“ Leveraged probabilistic forecasts to support real-time
public health decision-making

* ðŸ”— **Multimodal Data Integration** â€“ Combined self-reported survey data with case count time series to enhance model accuracy

* ðŸ“Š **Communicating Uncertainty** â€“ Created clear, decision-relevant visualizations for probabilistic outcomes and behavioral drivers

### What I Learned

How to turn crowdsourced human behavior data into probabilistic forecasts using Bayesian modelingâ€”providing community leaders and health systems with more informative, uncertainty-aware predictions of epidemic spread.

## <u>What we were interested in </u>

What if we could improve pandemic forecasting by asking people how well their neighbors are following the rules?

Modeling the path of an infectious disease is a popular and important area of
research,[^model1]<sup>,</sup>[^model2] hugely supporting public health situational awareness during a pandemic.[^important1]<sup>,</sup>[^important2] Most models are purely *computational*,
meaning they rely only on existing data found on the internet to support their
predictions. [^computational1]<sup>,</sup>[^computational2] However, including
data generated by humans has been proven to enhance forecasting infectious
diseases.[^human1]<sup>,</sup>[^human2]<sup>,</sup>[^human3]<sup>,</sup>[^human4]

> You can't know what you don't know until you know it.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC issued many *non-pharmaceutical
interventions* (NPIs), or behavior-based ways of mitigating the spread of the
disease (eg, social distancing). During the pandemic, I'm sure we all had some
intuitions around whether people were adhering to these NPIs, and how that
adherence changed throughout the course of the pandemic. We wanted to know
whether this information---the degree to which people were adhering to
NPIs---could improve predictions of infectious disease spread.

Whether people are adhering to NPIs is a tricky thing to measure.
