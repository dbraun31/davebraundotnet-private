### TL;DR

I built models that accurately predicted COVID-19 case numbers up to three weeks aheadâ€”using not just case data, but also how well people thought their communities were following safety guidelines like social distancing. This approach shows how public perception can be used to improve real-time forecasting tools for organizations like the CDC.

### Key Skills

- ðŸ“ˆ **Time-Series Forecasting** â€“ Applied epidemiological models to predict COVID-19
  cases using behavioral and clinical data

- ðŸ§  **Bayesian Modeling** â€“ Leveraged probabilistic forecasts to support real-time
  public health decision-making

- ðŸ”— **Multimodal Data Integration** â€“ Combined self-reported survey data with case count time series to enhance model accuracy

- ðŸ“Š **Communicating Uncertainty** â€“ Created clear, decision-relevant visualizations for probabilistic outcomes and behavioral drivers

### What I Learned

How to turn crowdsourced human behavior data into probabilistic forecasts using Bayesian modelingâ€”providing community leaders and health systems with more informative, uncertainty-aware predictions of epidemic spread.

## <u>What we were interested in </u>

### What if we could improve pandemic forecasting by asking people how well their neighbors are following the rules?

Modeling the path of an infectious disease is a popular and important area of
research,[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2] hugely supporting public health
situational awareness during a pandemic.[^3]<sup>,</sup>[^4]
Most models of infectious disease are purely *computational*, meaning they rely
only on existing data found on the internet to support their predictions.
[^5]<sup>,</sup>[^6] However, including data generated
by humans has been proven to enhance forecasting infectious
diseases.[^7]<sup>,</sup>[^8]<sup>,</sup>[^9]<sup>,</sup>[^10]

> </p>

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC issued many *non-pharmaceutical
interventions* (NPIs), or behavior-based ways of mitigating the spread of the
disease (eg, social distancing). During the pandemic, Iâ€™m sure we all had some
intuitions around whether people were adhering to these NPIs, how that adherence
changed throughout the course of the pandemic, and how effective that NPI might
have been for reducing the spread of the disease. In this study,
we wanted to know whether the degree to which people were adhering to NPIs could
improve predictions of infectious disease spread, and see which NPIs improved
predictions the most.

## <u> How we did it </u>

### We asked a crowd 21 questions about their communityâ€™s compliance with NPIs over 35 weeks and tested whether their responses improved COVID-19 case forecasts
