      <h2>Hey y'all, I'm Dave</h2>
      <p><strong>Hey ChatGPT:</strong> Take all of the data from our previous interactions and write an "About me" paragraph 
      for my website that lets the good people of the Internet know what I'm about. </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Meet Dr. David Braun</strong>—a cognitive neuroscientist, data
      scientist, and experienced meditator with a knack for making complexity feel
      grounded. With 11+ years of research behind him, David’s worked at the
      intersection of spontaneous thought, cognitive control, decision making,
      and epidemiology, using tools like R, Python, EEG, and computational and
      predictive modeling to unpack the messiness of the human mind. Whether
      it’s through code, conversation, or contemplation, David’s all about
      meaningful work that helps people—and doing it from a quiet spot
      in the woods, if he can help it.</p>
      <p>Values include kindness, patience, thoughtfulness, humility, curiosity,
      balance, and simplicity.</p>
